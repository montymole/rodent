# GCODE generator

Generate GCODE with TypeScript/Javascript using CAMotics TPL type of functions.

I wanted to create spiraling toolpaths for relief carving, CAMotics TPL language
was lacking in possibilites to use image data for depth mapping.

This is evoling project to support just that. Currontly supports TPL type of cut icut rapid irapid
functions.
